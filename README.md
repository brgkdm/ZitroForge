## Overview

**ZitroForge** is a tool designed to highlight the dangers of fake Z(N)itro code generators commonly found online. It is not a genuine method for generating Z(D)iscord Z(N)itro codes.

This tool aims to provide a safe environment where people can recognize fraudulent software and understand how such programs work. This project does **not** generate real Z(D)iscord Z(N)itro codes or provide any functionality beyond educational awareness.
